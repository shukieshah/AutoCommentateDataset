well hello everybody and welcome to our
00:37
single play of vanilla 1.13 minecraft
00:41
series what's up how's everybody doing
00:43
man I'm super excited welcome to episode
00:45
1 hopefully we would have a bunch of
00:47
episodes back to back to back on this
00:49
world and this is gonna be our new
00:50
single-player 1:13 world and it's so so
00:53
cool I'm actually very inspired by this
00:55
world because this is the world that
00:56
I've been using recently for our biome
00:58
builds that we've been doing so there's
01:00
a lot of piles that are close by right
01:02
now we're in like a little Plains
01:03
there's a forest behind us the swamp is
01:05
over there we got extreme hills stuff
01:07
there's a bunch of things this out dark
01:09
oak forest over there there's ocean that
01:11
way
01:11
just check the sea down I'm gonna put
01:13
sea real fast there it is I'm gonna put
01:15
it in the description of the video from
01:16
here on in on the play that's gonna be
01:18
there if you want to play along this is
01:20
exactly where you spawn I can't wait and
01:22
I got big plans for this series - man
01:24
I'm very very happy very excited to
01:26
bring our single player vanilla survival
01:28
world back again and hopefully we're
01:31
gonna use this world for a very long
01:33
time and see how long we can keep it up
01:35
especially now we have one for 1.14
01:38
coming up soon we got the village and
01:40
pillage update coming up soon so
01:42
hopefully we could just use this world
01:44
and continue it on instead of starting a
01:46
fresh one we'll see what happens when we
01:48
get close to it but also I got a lot of
01:50
plans since we what we've been doing a
01:52
lot of biome builds I want to go ahead
01:53
this is my plan for this series of
01:56
course you know I like building right
01:57
you know I love me some building I plan
01:59
on doing since we have so many biomes
02:02
close by I want to do a village a biome
02:05
that's my goal that's not goal in the
02:07
series and we don't have to just stick
02:09
with one location over and over again
02:12
till we're done we could jump from biome
02:14
to biome for village to village and it's
02:16
gonna be a lot of fun we could do eight
02:17
swamp like maybe like a witch's coven
02:20
like village right here we could do a
02:22
nice little rustic medieval biome type
02:28
village over there in the forest we're
02:30
not going to that birch for that birch
02:31
for us right there don't touch that I'm
02:32
gonna burn that to the ground we can go
02:34
to different villages and make different
02:36
villages at different miles and that is
02:37
just so cool we can go like let's say a
02:40
snow biome and do a Nordic style village
02:42
we can
02:42
go to an extreme Hills biome and maybe
02:44
do like houses on the tops of the hills
02:46
and stilts is crazy stuff like that you
02:48
go to OSHA bio maybe to an underwater
02:50
metropolis down there or something we
02:53
can do a lot of cool stuff and I can't
02:54

we gotta get end up doing getting some
06:35
food I see you cows you won't get sliced
06:37
sliced up hey you know what I'm thinking
06:39
about since this is our technically our
06:41
spawn area I might do a starter house
06:44
right in the heart of our spawn and like
06:47
I always do I usually do this is what I
06:51
do was with starter houses I go big you
06:53
know go big or go home
06:54
but I think we're gonna change up our
06:57
style for once and not say it's a
07:00
starter house and build like a giant
07:02
medieval town in the first episode so
07:06
I'm thinking about taking this slow
07:08
we're going to
07:09
the slow we're gonna go like normal
07:11
people would and just do a nice small
07:13
starter house something just to make us
07:15
happy
07:16
and I think we might even do it right
07:17
here in this little open field it might
07:19
be a cool little spot this area looks
07:21
really good I might just do a play oh we
07:23
can go exploring down there too but
07:25
really quick let me do this I think I'm
07:27
gonna get scatter some warmer materials
07:29
and I think we're gonna build something
07:31
oh that's a pretty little spot Oh with
07:33
horses too oh I think I like this spot
07:36
right here but so much birch huh okay
07:39
let me do this real fast let me pick a
07:40
spot let me get the materials ready and
07:42
we'll do our first little starter house
07:44
right here see we can just make it very
07:47
nice and cool I don't think I'm gonna go
07:48
in this swamp no swamp starter house not
07:50
now we'll build something later in the
07:52
swamp but let me find a good spot let me
07:54
get some materials I'll be right back
07:55

07:56

08:29

08:53

so a little box right here we're gonna
13:39
put a little door there could be a
13:40
little bedroom maybe that's looking
13:43
awesome so here and here and I'm
13:45
thinking I want to have like a little
13:48
crop
13:49
section here I'm not sure where to put
13:51
it but like see what if we have also
13:55

13:58
set you know here like a little overhang
13:59

14:02
haven't like a little porch a little
14:03

14:06
three why baby let's go like that like
14:09
that let's bring this down let's see
14:11
this come on it's coming up pretty good
14:12
so far but um I'm totally winging it
14:15
hopefully comes out okay and then here
14:17
we could just mix and match some of this
14:19
I might bring in some stone we're gonna
14:20
cook some more cobble we'll see I don't
14:22
know if it's gonna last me the whole way
14:23
let's see how we're doing it okay and
14:26
then here just gonna cover this up with
14:28
some random blockage right here we're
14:30
gonna use just stone and cobble like
14:33
this maybe something like that
14:36
Oh miss click so we're gonna see if we
14:40
could build Moses on cans I know you
14:42
guys love it then I build stuff on cam
14:44
again oh and I was able to get enough
14:46
materials now that we are pretty good
14:48
we're good enough as far as our tools we
14:52
just have enough to make an iron pick in
14:54
an iron axe so we're just just starting
14:56
out and then I was able to get full iron
14:58
armor and that was it that we heard we
14:59
have no more nothing else left so this
15:02
is it we got to go and mine a little
15:04
more so something like this is good for
15:06
starters I think this is good and then
15:09
I'm gonna go with now some oak beams and
15:13
I'm gonna go with oak beam here so let's
15:14

15:32
one six five on this one so one two
15:34
three four five and it's a five is that
15:38

15:50

16:05
smaller maybe a little Rufe on this one
16:06
I make this a little taller a little
16:07
taller roof on this overhang over here
16:09
and then on this side we'll do like a
16:11
little outside garden area and we'll
16:14
maybe do a little sloping roof right
16:16
here with a bunch of crops on that side
16:18
that's looking pretty good I'm thinking
16:20
if we do here maybe do something like
16:21
that that looks good
16:23
and then back here we could do did I run
16:26
out no I didn't there's something like
16:27
that to match that side and I might do
16:31
double log right there I might do a
16:34
double log right there that looks good
16:38
and it's gonna be covered up okay I
16:40
think this is looking all right let me
16:41
make a day time though I'm gonna build
16:43
this up I just gonna add in between
16:45
these guys I'm just gonna mix and match
16:47
some of the strip oak and the regular
16:51
oak and we're just gonna go up with it
16:53
like this so let me do this real fast
16:55
I'm gonna lift this all up like this and
16:58
I'll be right back make any time
16:59
hopefully no bad guys come I need to put
17:01
some torches around here and I'll be
17:02
right back with you guys give you a
17:03
little progress update but something
17:04
like that
17:05
that's cute look at that all right music
17:07
all right so here we go this one we got
17:10
so far with a little starter house I'm
17:11
loving it it looks so so cool I brought
17:14
down the log all the way to the bottom
17:16
because I didn't feel right just having
17:17
it suspended over that foundation so it
17:20
looked pretty cool so I have Windows
17:21
given here I might put right here in the
17:23
middle
17:24
a big old fireplace thing right there in
17:27
the middle I have a little way up here
17:28
so I'm not sure if I think I might just
17:30
leave that closed off because I'm gonna
17:32
do that overhang for the crops right
17:34
here and I like what's happening ready I
17:36
did extend the little porch a little bit
17:39
and I'm gonna put some stairs so let's
17:41
put some stairs here and a couple little
17:43
stairs all right there and I'm thinking
17:45
about here just maybe doing fence fence
17:48
fence fence and then a little gate gate
17:51
gate right there and that looks very
17:53
very cool
17:54
I might replace some of these with
17:55
upside down stairs I'm not sure yet
17:57
we'll see and then coming up here I need
18:00
some sand we need to make some glass and
18:02
then doors and stuff that's fine
18:03
so cross beams are going all the way
18:06
around here and here I might leave this
18:08
part maybe a little arch way leave that
18:10
open so that's looking good have windows
18:12
all the way around here so that might be
18:14
a little either
18:16
bedroom or just I don't know I think
18:18
maybe just a bedroom just to come and
18:19
sleep quick and then upstairs we might
18:22
do some more stuff maybe a storage area
18:24
but let's work on what we're doing for
18:27
this owner a roof a roof so I'm studying
18:29
the roof right here for the smaller one
18:32
I can maybe do that first so let's see
18:35
let's work on this thing so the I'm
18:36
gonna go with an outer border of stone
18:38
going like this and we're gonna take it
18:40
all the way to the end I'm gonna come
18:42
this way the same old thing and then I
18:45
messed up I picked it up late I'll
18:48
probably forget and it's gone forever
18:49
but it's fine so we're gonna go with
18:52
some offset downstairs here and both of
18:53
these guys what happened here
18:55
what did you do we think
18:58
plop okay cool I'm thinking about for
19:01
this we can go ahead and do it just a
19:03
little taller so just like a full block
19:05
stair coming around this way full block
19:09
stair and do this kind of roof out just
19:13
didn't give it a little bit more detail
19:15
and then if you make it just high enough
19:17
it does make it look a little cooler I
19:20
might go with a pop out log here we
19:22
don't have much wood left we're gonna go
19:24
maybe knocking some of these down and
19:26
replanting so I'm gonna do it'll pop out
19:28
right there do something like this
19:30
maybe something very small and simple
19:33
something like that very simple and then
19:35
coming back in here let's see let's take
19:38
this away I might break it up later but
19:40
for now I'm gonna make it very plain and
19:42
just go up with stairs and planks just
19:44
like so okay get out of here gate I
19:48
don't want you around and then just come
19:50
in straight down like this so I'm gonna
19:51
go do this also on the other side do a
19:55
little pop out log that kind of takes it
19:57
right to there and for now I'm just
19:58
gonna put full blocks of stone there and
20:02
that might look pretty cool so Lexie
20:04
let's finish this off this is gonna be
20:06
very simple so I might do this part just
20:09
finish I'm not gonna do it off cam it's
20:11
a real fast so right here boom so we
20:13
have this nice little roof right there
20:15
that looks awesome and then over here
20:17
let's make a bigger roof a roof and I
20:21
might do a little overhang here too
20:22
maybe a balcony I'm not sure yet a
20:25
chicken coming out of the water like
20:27
that
20:28
so Lexie how would I do this
20:29
gonna put a stair here stair here Oh
20:33
what what's the what are you going down
20:35
there weird stair get out of here so I'm
20:38
gonna put something like this perfect
20:40
actually this oh this might be pretty
20:41
cool because we're gonna overhang it and
20:43
it's gonna go over this guy so let's do
20:45
one so we're gonna make it a little
20:46
bigger just like that just okay have
20:49
enough clearance to go over one and then
20:52
BAM and so that was a - no that was a 1
20:55
a 2 a 1 I'm thinking yeah right how did
20:59
I do this alright so I'll put a stair
21:00
two blocks then it's there one block and
21:04
a stair ok perfect and that one block
21:05
and a stair and that should be perfect
21:07
to get to the middle yes it is and then
21:09
bomb and ooh we have to put our pop-up
21:12
log there hold on let's pop this out
21:15
real fast we're gonna put a pop-out log
21:17
here and then this goes there and then
21:20
we got a full block and then we got our
21:23
little stair and or flip a little
21:24
flippity bit right there that looks good
21:25
alright nice let's see let's come over
21:28
here let's go around see if this is tall
21:30
enough Oh baby baby yes that is perfect
21:35
that is perfect as far as the overhang
21:38
mmm not sure if I'm gonna go with the
21:42
balcony or not but if we do if we do do
21:44
an overhang do we have any we don't hold
21:47
on let's make some real fast a couple of
21:51
these bad boys this is he--oh to look
21:52
like so if we're doing overhang it'll go
21:54
like this like that like this like that
21:57
and I think maybe how would it be if I
22:02
get let me get a fence can I put a fence
22:05
right on that yes I could so we could
22:08
definitely put a fence on this guy not
22:11
there though but um the other one so
22:13
that would be a thing and then if we go
22:16
oh I know maybe like that that might be
22:29
cool and then take this guy all the way
22:32
down all right now that's fine I'll come
22:34
back two more yeah yeah yeah that's cool
22:37
and then in here do we have any yeah we
22:41
have these okay let's see what this
22:42
looks like
22:43
so we would have to put those in this
22:45
direction here and then our fence would
22:49
go there oh yeah that looks so good
22:54
okay let me do this really quick off
22:56
gammy cam I'm just gonna repeat the same
22:58
pattern on this side and this little
23:01
overhang all the way to here and I bring
23:03
you guys back and we'll see a little
23:04
progress on this thing I'm loving this
23:06
this is so cool I love this starter
23:07
house it's not too crazy right not too
23:09
big it's totally doable okay I think if
23:11
you stay gonna be Rebecca
23:12
all right so progress update I ended up
23:15
putting this cool little pattern over
23:16
here too we actually added some birch
23:18
strips variety and some oak to that and
23:23
that looks really really cool I like
23:24
that I like the contrast with that light
23:26
colored strip birch log that virtual log
23:28
man stripped is beautiful and then over
23:31
here and then I put in the roof looks
23:33
awesome I'm gonna put some windows here
23:35
in here and then also on this side and
23:37
in the pudding that little fireplace
23:38
that I wanted to put right there look
23:40
how cool that looks totally random but I
23:43
want to put some regular stone in there
23:44
too I'm gonna take this tree out of the
23:47
way but that looks cool and I put the
23:48
windows in here as well and that looks
23:50
really really awesome look how cool that
23:51
looks I love it I love it but also then
23:54
a little layout on the interior as well
23:56
so come with me so right here we're
23:58
gonna put the little fireplace and
23:59
looking thing I'm gonna use this like
24:00
for cooking or a kitchen pretty big
24:03
right here so we have this little area
24:05
look at really nice I ended up using
24:06
this little thing here as a spiral
24:09
staircase so this little part over here
24:11
looks awesome you can maybe do a little
24:12
basement down here later on but the
24:14
spiral came out really good it just goes
24:16
right up to here and cuts this direction
24:18
have this little trap doors a little
24:19
banister there and it looks really
24:21
really awesome I might use this section
24:23
as storage right here and this is gonna
24:25
be like the bedroom area and then we got
24:27
a detail the ceilings but it looks
24:28
really really cool I love it but let me
24:30
show you how we're doing this so this
24:32
one I'm gonna go up one two three four
24:34
so one out one two three four and I
24:39
think it's gonna break this piece off
24:41
here and here take this I'm thinking
24:45
just right here right to there right to
24:48
here maybe a little pop out lucky right
24:51
there and then bring in full block a
24:54
little stair and
24:56
stare here take this on all the way down
24:58
and take this piece out and then connect
25:01
this whole area right there I think
25:02
that's gonna look really awesome let's
25:04
do that one more time so one two three
25:05
four one two three four I'm gonna drop
25:09
that guy that guy pop out doggy
25:13
right there take it out full block stare
25:19
stare connect it out boom boom and then
25:22
drop this guy right in here
25:23
let's ooh this looks like let's cut down
25:24
here and also I'm thinking about maybe
25:27
right here doing a Lexie stare and stare
25:32
and we have another window right there I
25:33
think that's awesome let's check it out
25:34
I would put a little window right there
25:37
let's get down let's see what this looks
25:38
like
25:38
ow oh wow that is cool that is really
25:42
really cool I love that oh that's
25:45
awesome okay so what I'm gonna do is let
25:46
me repeat that on the other side let me
25:48
put some glass I think I have some class
25:50
cooking so I think I just gonna go with
25:52
regular class I don't have any dyes oh
25:54
and I didn't get some brick I want to
25:56
add those somewhere soon but let me make
25:59
some a glass a glass how do we do this
26:02
let me go okay perfect six thing you
26:04
should be good okay just in cases make
26:06
some more oh and we're using our board
26:08
inators clear glass packs oh this looks
26:10
really really awesome if you notice also
26:12
the bushy bushes we you think germs it
26:15

26:18

26:21

26:22
as you guys could check that out but let
26:23
me put some glass let me repeat this
26:25
little window a sexiness on the other
26:28
side look how clear that glass looks so
26:30
good
26:31
and I'll come back in a second and we'll
26:32
do some details alright alright this is
26:36
this is getting really cool now I'm
26:38
loving this building so much this is
26:40
really one of my favorite starter houses
26:41
so I went ahead and I beat up all this
26:44
up so I put if we set of slabs I put
26:46
four blocks some of these instead of
26:48
stairs I put slams so I messed this all
26:50
up put some upside down stairs some
26:52
regular stairs I made it all pretty
26:53
rustic over here I added this little
26:55
overhang so I decided to make this into
26:57
a little balcony know why not right
27:00
this side definitely needed some extra
27:01
love so one with this little part here I
27:03
went with our little stair trick we
27:05
waterlogged that so we can actually put
27:07
some crops down so let's put this real
27:08
fast
27:09
put a little clop start a crop field
27:11
right here and I do have here we go yes
27:15
we got another advancement so we have
27:18
this down here it's a perfect little
27:19
starter spot for the crops I love it
27:22
and we can close that up another thing
27:24
we could do as well let's come over here
27:27
for a second let's see oh you see I beat
27:30
this up as well I gotta get rid of this
27:31
to be trade uh and then this looks
27:33
really really cool did it on this side
27:34
as well look so nice we also have some
27:36
pots of flour plus I want to scatter a
27:39
little bit of flowerpot X you can't see
27:40
it there but it'll look nice I also want
27:42
to put a couple just scattered around in
27:46
certain spots just make it random maybe
27:48
another one over here on the outside
27:50
because put some on the inside as well
27:51
and let me show you on the inside I want
27:54
to do a little section here for the
27:55
cooking so right here I'm thinking about
27:58
doing one two three um let's see four
28:04
five something like that make it look
28:06
cool then a little maybe upside down
28:08
stair here a double upside down stair
28:11
right there might look pretty cool and
28:13
then up here I could put like cakes
28:15
later on maybe a little an extra little
28:17
flowerpot maybe one of these side for
28:19
now maybe a little cake up there that
28:20
looks awesome and then the stuff we
28:23
could do as well I wanted to remove this
28:26
I got a couple extra bricks out of this
28:27
so maybe take this little part out and
28:29
maybe brick this little section off a
28:32
little bit like right there that looks
28:34
awesome I love that you know we look
28:36
pretty cool maybe a little bit of
28:37
granite down there even though I hate
28:39
granny but mixing it with a brick might
28:40
look pretty pretty cool
28:42
and I think that's good I don't think I
28:44
want to put any windows on this side so
28:46
that's looking okay I might do like a
28:47
little seating area over here
28:50
don't know what materials we have maybe
28:52
if we make some of the birch here and do
28:55
a little crafting bench actually what
28:58
can I sneak a crafting bench here I
29:00
don't want to make it too crazy out of
29:04
the way maybe right over maybe down here
29:06
maybe down here the little crafting
29:09
bench right on the floor hidden that's
29:10
cool maybe put a little carpet around I
29:12
don't know we'll see so I want to do
29:14
some stairs here let's do some birch and
29:18
then we can do one here one here we
29:22
could do a little
29:23
since action or this bad guys coming
29:25
let's see maybe a little let's see is it
29:29
safe oh close that door
29:31
okay let's see oh no we got fence we got
29:34
fence this here I was gonna make a bird
29:35
face but no that's fine and then maybe a
29:38
little exceed maybe a little birch
29:42
pressure plants maybe so let's replace
29:45
that boom very nice maybe one here to
29:48
get into now oh they're so bright I
29:49
might change that whatever so that looks
29:52
really really good maybe we could do
29:54
some sign action here oh man and I can't
29:57
wait for 114 or not even 114 I think is
30:00
the next snapshot for 113 we're gonna
30:02
get colored signs isn't that gonna be
30:04
amazing we can make bird signs for this
30:08
we just said that Oh baby some spruce
30:11
signs dark oak signs is gonna be so good
30:13
scary that's way too bright I'm sorry I
30:15
gotta get rid of that horrible let's do
30:18
a yeah let's do one of these bad boys
30:21
here we'll make a little birch pressure
30:23
plates I think this will be a little
30:24
better look see a lot better okay cool
30:28
so we have this little area I do need to
30:29
get some paintings on this side that
30:32
looks really really good maybe some a
30:34
chest action down here some starter
30:37
chest action we could just maybe line it
30:40
up a couple on this side couple on that
30:42
side this is for a basement later on but
30:44
for now you know why we could just do a
30:45
little hidden storage right there that's
30:48
fine over here I think that's good for
30:52
the top though we do need to add some
30:54
more details I'm saying here definitely
30:57
good to storage I'm thinking if we do it
31:00
it's gonna be starter stores we could
31:01
just do I gotta get some more but maybe
31:03
stack up right here stack up some over
31:06
here oh this needs some more love maybe
31:09
we could do something like that I think
31:11
I could get rid of this piece right here
31:13
or I can maybe crossbeam that actually
31:16
oh no I didn't mean to UM okay now we're
31:22
almost finished with this episode let me
31:24

32:47
item frames on these torches but it's
32:49
looking really cool I push back the
32:50
chairs a little bit just so I can have
32:52
these little bushy bushy plant actions
32:55
here looking very awesome a little
32:57
spiral staircase going up to the top so
32:59
we have our storage right here more
33:01
storage on the side and then I love that
33:04
ceiling take a look at that take a look
33:06
at that ceiling a really really cool
33:07
door action here our bed and then we
33:10
have the same pattern on the ceiling
33:12
right there looking awesome and then our
33:14
little balcony overlooking this
33:15
beautiful little area I can't wait to
33:17
expand all around here looking very cool
33:19
just a random poor storage here so
33:21
definitely starter storage we're gonna
33:22
have to make a storage silo somewhere
33:25
one area I don't know what we're gonna
33:27
do maybe a big old storage building like
33:29
right here we got all this space to work
33:31

33:41
this oh and this is growing lovely we're
33:43
almost done with that crop thing thing
33:46
so we have this little pool okay
33:49
odd thing here because I might pretty
33:52
this up a little bit and make it really
33:55
nice maybe heavier like a little fishing
33:56
hole or something like that it might be
33:58
pretty really really really awesome and
34:00
some custom trees around here so that's
34:01
something we can work on soon also I
34:03
really want to work on having a nice
34:06
little mine entrance over here so I
34:08

34:12
really cool and then also do some more
34:14
terraforming over here make it look
