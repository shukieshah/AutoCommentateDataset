00:00
welcome back everybody to Minecraft 1.13
00:03
in a brand new world I hope you guys are
00:06
excited because what can I say I'm I'm
00:08
very very excited this has been a few
00:10
months in the in the works and finally
00:12
we're in it so for people who are new
00:15
welcome my name is Jan see and for
00:17
people returning from our last series or
00:19
from a long time ago it is great to see
00:21
you guys back here again enough of that
00:22
let's let's go ahead get started in the
00:25
the survival minecraft stuff it's it's
00:27
actually it's kind of odd so for people
00:30
who don't know we've got two previous
00:31
worlds on YouTube and oh you can see
00:33
some new recipes already going getting
00:35
started with some of this stuff it's
00:37
just such a cool feeling to just get
00:39
started a brand new world but as I say
00:40
for people who are new here we are a
00:43
building channel really we love to build
00:45
we love to play Minecraft in survival
00:47
mode and have a great adventure and if
00:49
you guys aren't familiar we've got two
00:51
previous series on YouTube which have
00:53
have been our pride and joy actually
00:56
I've really thoroughly enjoyed playing
00:59
survival minecraft and this is no
01:00
different that's the reason why we've
01:02
got this third world which is gonna be
01:03
absolutely awesome ender and I'm sure
01:05
it's gonna be a real good time so as I
01:08
say for you guys who are new welcome
01:09
good to have you guys here so let's
01:11
let's just quickly get some kind of an
01:13
idea of where we standing let's let's
01:15
start with the game enough about that
01:17
that's the channel game time so we're
01:19
currently standing on an island and you
01:21
may ask how do I know that the way I
01:23
know that is because I decided to choose
01:25
a seed that will make sure that we do
01:27
not get lost we don't we don't have
01:29
something that is going to hold us back
01:31
in the future that we have to travel at
01:33
tens of thousands of blocks just to see
01:35
something so I decided oh I would have a
01:38
look at some good seeds and we would
01:40
pick a seed together and the seed that I
01:42
chose and what most people chose now
01:44
this could be our first bit of damage so
01:46
nailed it no it won't be but the seat
01:49
that I chose was seat number three from
01:51
my seed selection video so if a lot of
01:53
people are looking for seeds of course
01:55
we've got a video out there for you guys
01:56
to check out but this was the seed that
01:58
we chose which has a good cut a good
02:01
bunch of things for instance icebergs of
02:03
islands just in general islands corals
02:06
not too far off in that direction and
02:07
I've got a general idea of where I want
02:09
to go in this world and what we want to
02:11
do which i think is still enough for us
02:13
to
02:13
a real good solid adventure and a good
02:16
amount of exploration because I haven't
02:17
haven't explored this world very very
02:19
thoroughly so that's what we can do over
02:21
here now as far as I'm aware there's
02:22
this island which we spawner which is
02:24
sort of an island it's got a few little
02:26
land connections but it's mostly an
02:29
island I mean dig of dig up probably
02:31
five blocks it will probably have an
02:32
island showing here but other than that
02:36
let's quickly talk about some of the
02:37
cool things with the series and while we
02:39
do that hopefully we'll be able to come
02:40
across in fact let's go down to the
02:42
south because we'll have more water to
02:44
go and explore because this is of course
02:45
1.13 update aquatic the good times so of
02:49
course let's go down south and we'll
02:51
wrap around this island see what we can
02:52
see and enjoy also the the icebergs from
02:55
this spawn because I mean hey it's it's
02:57
a very different spawn we may as well
02:58
make that and make that a feature of
03:01
this world
03:01
so can we go I think no this yet we
03:04
can't cool perfect we'll get one of
03:06
these and OH
03:07
make this is this over here maybe we
03:10
should keep this we'll take this or pick
03:11
it up and this will be our first
03:13
crafting table I I never really do stuff
03:14
like this keep something special last
03:16
time in my world I well I guess kind of
03:18
I I remembered the date the very minute
03:21
very second we started the world this
03:23
time I remember the first crafting table
03:25
we'll keep this one safe so very
03:28
important stuff as you can imagine so
03:29
we'll go around here and maybe just see
03:31
if we can see any runes we'll go and
03:33
swim down to them if not we'll we'll
03:35
make our way to the mainland but I'd
03:37
like to get started at the mainland to
03:38
begin with what is going on yeah yeah
03:41
you sit there buddy you sit there it's
03:44
as I was saying there are a few cool
03:46
things which are going to be slightly
03:47
different in this world from the last
03:49
world so mostly our building is going to
03:52
still be kind of like a fantasy
03:55
hopefully even more fantasy all turtles
03:57
I didn't even realize turtle spawned in
03:59
the cold biomes that is really cool I
04:01
hope they I hope they don't hurt us but
04:02
I'd like to you oh yes swim let's check
04:04
yeah these guys are a pretty neat all
04:07
right
04:07
well we'll just go back to the boat I
04:09
just want to check him out and actually
04:10
let's just do this get out get our
04:14
breath back but yeah as I say I mean
04:16
listen I'm getting so distracted here
04:18
but some things that I would like to be
04:21
able to at least is there is there a
04:23
chest in here I don't see any chest okay
04:26
we've been
04:27
bamboozled we've been bamboozled quick
04:29
get out we're probably going to take a
04:31
little bit of damage no we made it
04:32
beautiful so a few things that are gonna
04:34
be different for the one millionth time
04:36
is that we are going to be taking this
04:38
taking this easy so there are there are
04:40
a few things that I left in the last
04:42
world which I really kind of it kind of
04:45
bugged me a little bit so building
04:46
extremely large X like extremely spread
04:49
out we're not gonna be doing that we're
04:50
gonna be building a lot what's
04:51
heightened it a lot more detail in our
04:53
builds and I think that's something that
04:55
I made a mistake with in the last world
04:57
which of course we gotta have a good
04:58
time over here and in terms of the the
05:00
survival parts of it there are a few
05:02
things in survival which we maybe are
05:04
negotiable for instance phytic I've
05:06
always played with fire take on I think
05:08
maybe we could take a break from
05:09
calculating distances of blocks and I
05:11
think it can only improve our builds and
05:13
really I mean we've we've we've
05:16
definitely proven to ourselves we can
05:17
handle it you know what I'd love to know
05:19
is just how much stuff underneath this
05:21
water there is that we could be
05:23
exploring that I'm just not noticing
05:24
right now I mean it's it's pretty dark
05:26
out that way and there's a little bit of
05:27
a cheat way you can see through this
05:29
through the horizon over there what's
05:31
going on but if I think this is the
05:33
mainland well we'll just keep going I'm
05:34
pretty sure there's a village just
05:36
around here which i think would be
05:37
pretty cool to start with but you know
05:39
what hopefully it's not it throws me off
05:41
completely and then we can we can find
05:43
ourselves lost what we want to do also
05:45
there are by the way in this world a lot
05:48
of biomes for instance the coral and
05:50
this one over here in the water which
05:52
are going to be awesome for us to just
05:53
go around and explore I think they'll be
05:55
good that we don't have to travel out
05:56
too far that's an in oh there's the
05:58
village there that's a very interesting
06:01
mountain range I like that a lot it's
06:04
very very cool and by the way this over
06:05
here is one big island which is
06:08
something that's super cool and I
06:10
actually forgot about that well I didn't
06:12
realize that until just then that we
06:13
were right next to the big island so
06:15
here we go let's let's make land but
06:18
that was the update aquatic guys great
06:20
to have you guys here and now let's go
06:22
into the land either way you know what I
06:24
think this update has got something even
06:26
better than the oceans it brought us so
06:29
many beautiful blocks for us who who
06:31
like to build the world they're building
06:32
our world and make it pretty maybe do
06:34
some cool things that's what we've got
06:36
we've got some cool blocks to explore
06:38
and here is a cool village to explore
06:40
which
06:40
you can see has got a blacksmith I
06:42
really like this in fact I looked at
06:44
this before in a video and I thought it
06:46
was rather cool that we had a little
06:49
Mountain over here a little hill more
06:51
like it really would be exaggerating if
06:53
I said Mountain but having this little
06:55
hill over here is is really cool now
06:57
first thing to check we've got two main
06:58
things and also by the way we've got a
07:00
texture pack if you guys don't know my
07:01
texture pack it's super vanilla as
07:03
vanilla as possible just fixes up a few
07:05
things that I don't like for instance
07:06
the the radioactive coloured actually
07:11
we're going here the radioactive colored
07:13
that is good that is good start
07:16
give me all those please Oh ready
07:20
getting ahead of it we'll just move this
07:21
over today and for the last time the
07:23
radioactive colored crops now the next
07:25
thing we have to do is we've check this
07:26
out we have to really which was the
07:28
first thing that I didn't actually
07:29
finish is look for a librarian in the
07:33
village because if we can get a
07:34
librarian and hopefully with mending man
07:36
how great of us start was happy but you
07:39
know what I've had so many lucky starts
07:41
in Minecraft I think I think I can't
07:45
count on it but you know maybe it's just
07:48
gonna be a rule that it keeps class
07:49
carrying on they're not not nothing up
07:51
can't see any unless the last house last
07:54
two houses now you are I think a butcher
07:57
right yeah a butcher alright cool so
08:00
what I was thinking this is my plan at
08:02
least and with I should really not run
08:03
too much let's go get ourselves some
08:06
sheep I saw planes over here we can
08:07
maybe get some sheep so we can sleep the
08:09
first night away which is always a good
08:11
thing if we can find some sheep know
08:14
there's some sheep up there so if we can
08:16
sleep the first night away there is a
08:18
pro survival tip for myself
08:20
yep get a bed the next thing is going to
08:22
be I want to get some wood and we've got
08:24
dark oak we've got birch we've got oak I
08:26
think that's a that's some good stuff so
08:29
we can get ourselves a starter house
08:31
made today and most importantly about
08:33
this starter house actually we'll just
08:35
do sorry sheep you're going as well we
08:38
need the food the most important thing
08:40
about this starter house I think will be
08:41
that it's it's something we can get
08:43
started with that's simple I don't want
08:44
to be I don't want this stuff to be too
08:46
crazy but I still want it to be alright
08:48
and and look good at least we can maybe
08:50
keep it for a while and if you guys
08:52
don't know me I do love
08:54
love my building a lot like I really do
08:57
so prepare yourselves it's it's gonna
08:59
it's gonna make this world look real
09:01
good and of course if while we at this
09:03
and the two-headed villager are these
09:07
worth the same armor and how do i
09:10
separate these guys I wonder if they've
09:13
they've spawned in with the same stuff I
09:15
need to I need to figure this out so
09:16
let's make ourselves a piece of coal
09:19
first it all LLL burn just the one but
09:22
yeah what I was saying is actually well
09:25
it's been just alone yeah so if you got
09:26
a sign familiar with the channel of
09:27
course we've got a world tour for the
09:28
last world which will give you some idea
09:30
of what we could be doing in this world
09:32
which I think will be will be a good bit
09:34
of insight for you guys now I wonder if
09:36
these guys are stuck let's leave them
09:38
I'm not gonna worry too much about him
09:39
and let's while we while we wait for
09:41
that we'll put down our crafting table
09:43
we'll put it in the blacksmith because
09:45
it's an easy house to remember where
09:47
we're at okay and I'm still in the habit
09:49
of going for my my ax on number two so
09:52
let's just do that over there make
09:54
ourself a bed and we will be safe for
09:58
the first night that's a that's a very
09:59
lucky thing and we'll put it in this in
10:01
this one over here perfect so yeah we've
10:04
got a world so if you guys want to check
10:05
out our previous world and besides that
10:07
also if you if you guys are new to the
10:08
channel as I say it's a warm welcome to
10:10
you and and also the fact that we are
10:12
all we we stream on Twitch so if you
10:14
guys don't know about that do you want
10:15
to figure out what's going on in our
10:17
last world or just follow us on the live
10:19
stream at least twitch is the place to
10:21
be checking us out so we are kind of
10:23
lucky in the pub wait not there with the
10:26
fact that we have managed to get
10:27
ourselves iron so I'm going to do that
10:29
because we're gonna be chopping down
10:30
trees I want to keep I want to keep
10:32
myself away from wood as much as pot
10:34
from stone as much as possible this in
10:37
this series I've I've made it so so much
10:39
wild made someone so much stuff with
10:42
wood with stone dang it
10:43
then I want to I want to turn to wood
10:45
and make a lot more wooden things I want
10:47
to mix up the block pallet of it and I
10:48
think I guess we're getting started here
10:50
let's let's try and transform for our
10:52
first episode we're gonna transform this
10:54
into a beautiful house and by beautiful
10:57
house I am pretty sure we could get it
10:59
I'm pretty confident that with the time
11:01
we've got here so one rule let's see how
11:04
much wood we can gather in one day I'm
11:05
gonna go chop down birch
11:06
oak and dark oak let's get to it and do
11:10
a successful day we just had it's coming
11:12
to a close you can see we might actually
11:14
just get some mob spawning around here
11:16
which could give us despite having a bit
11:18
of rotten flesh it could give us an
11:20
opportunity to get ourselves out first
11:23
our first achievement for that but what
11:25
is it mob something I don't know
11:27
either way we really had a great day and
11:28
I'll quickly explain to you what's
11:30
happened I've got a bunch of dark oak
11:32
which is gonna be awesome
11:34
I've got a bunch of well not actually
11:35
too much I got sixty-one oak logs which
11:37
is a very good start and and mud I just
11:39
add I said I don't think we are too
11:42
lucky now not getting a many villager
11:44
which i think is a pretty pretty big
11:46
pretty big ask but realistically we've
11:50
started with iron tools
11:51
that is a very very big actually hey con
11:54
sog refer how you doing man put you up
11:55
many villagey a librarian but that's
11:57
right you come out there all the door
11:59
but yeah either way that's it that's a
12:01
very successful day and I didn't even
12:02
realize that I did I didn't actually I
12:04
did actually notice that that that was a
12:06
great great thing to be to have there so
12:09
we've got a few cool things and most
12:11
importantly one - what is that one two
12:15
three and a bit stacks of dark oak we
12:17
got spruce I had I actually realized
12:19
just on the other side of the dark oak
12:21
biome there is a spruce pine so I've
12:23
managed to get a spruce saplings which
12:24
is fantastic well to actually so drop
12:27
them there just in case we need them cuz
12:29
man everybody's favorite trap door is a
12:31
spruce trap door you can't deny that
12:33
that is fantastic so let's just get
12:35
started I'm thinking this blacksmith
12:37
because of course we've got fire tick
12:39
turned off at the moment which as I say
12:41
it's negotiable so it's negotiable will
12:43
change some stuff up but I'm fighting is
12:46
turned off so I think I'm pretty sure
12:47
wouldn't even cause us so a bit of grief
12:49
here but what up boo however these guys
12:51
just spawned frost Walker okay that's
12:53
not really too cool as awesome as frost
12:56
walk it is as an enchantment it's really
12:58
not that useful it's actually more more
12:59
of a pain in the butt than anything to
13:01
be completely honest but yeah what I was
13:03
saying is we've got to be doing a lot of
13:06
cool things around the world being at
13:08
building villages and and taking it
13:10
taking a smaller approach to building I
13:13
guess is the word now I've got a
13:15
question for all you guys because I know
13:16
there's a lot of avid builders out there
13:18
and people who just like seeing stuff in
13:20
Minecraft
13:20
what is something that you guys
13:23
absolutely love that you guys either see
13:26
a lot and tell me if you see it a lot in
13:27
Minecraft oh you never see it at all
13:28
what is something you would love to see
13:29
in terms of a village because of course
13:31
this is the very start of the world so
13:33
if you guys get a cool idea now it could
13:36
very well be built very very shortly if
13:38
not I've got a bunch of stuff let me
13:40
tell you a bunch of things that because
13:42
obviously having some very big projects
13:44
which shall be back from really doing
13:46
some of the cool bigger project other
13:47
cool smaller projects where I can get
13:48
some some little details and stuff these
13:50
guys doing you guys are freaking me out
13:52
here crowding me up we basically have
13:55
now got free reign to just do whatever
13:56
we feel like it and that's gonna be
13:58
really cool so any ideas you guys have
14:00
I'm I'm always I'd love to hear it
14:02
actually yeah you know let's let's do it
14:04
let's let's go crazy let's do a little
14:06
bit of that what's that one two three
14:08
your fourth one you take actually our
14:10
first have a heart of death I think I'm
14:12
pretty sure of death of the damage not
14:16
that bad come on Jesse calm down there
14:18
we go
14:19
beautiful and by the way to explain I
14:21
gotta keep remembering I don't have
14:23
feather falling anymore to explain the
14:26
the rotten flesh a zombie almost
14:27
attacked me and I didn't even have my
14:29
mom sounds turned up enough to have
14:30
heard that zombie how crazy is that
14:32
by the way pet peeve of mine well you
14:35
see you see there's a little oh well how
14:39
do I get wait what
14:41
how do I just get oh a cobblestone I
14:43
care that explains the fools for the
14:44
tools you see there that little pixel of
14:48
stuff that gets shown out when you have
14:50
a path block that's my pet peeve I can't
14:52
I can't stand that you know what we can
14:54
actually do yeah we could maybe maybe go
14:57
out one more in fact no no no we'll keep
14:59
it small we'll keep it narrow this is a
15:00
this is start a house dance you can't
15:02
get too crazy here man
15:04
beer what what what were you doing with
15:06
this is I'm just gonna go for a simple
15:08
style I think you guys can follow along
15:10
with if you guys are starting in your
15:11
own world or maybe even starting in this
15:13
world
15:13
I mean hey we've got we've got the seed
15:15
we've got the full future we'll
15:17
downloads will be in the description but
15:19
not right now but that'll that'll be in
15:21
the description there's going to be a
15:22
bunch of stuff in the description if you
15:23
guys want to get your hands in the
15:24
texture pack which as I say it it
15:26
changes a few of the things from vanilla
15:27
maybe a few things for instance of
15:29
leaves those are some of the new
15:30
textured the new default the future
15:33
default texture leaves
15:34
there's a whole bunch of little changes
15:36
the water of course many people will
15:39
probably pick up that that's slightly
15:40
different not a very big change but I
15:42
just I like the I like the lighter
15:43
colored water that we have over here it
15:45
just live-ins up the area a lot so of
15:48
course if you guys are in the market for
15:50
a fairly subtle vanilla texture pack I'm
15:53
your guy alright see that's that's in
15:56
the description as per as pretty usual
15:58
so this over here is actually gonna be
16:00
quite a skinny house and by the way
16:02
birch is now a beautiful block look at
16:05
this look at that
16:07
now birch finally I mean not they're not
16:11
the birch blocks but though these over
16:13
here are absolutely gorgeous blocks and
16:16
I love them so much
16:18
they there was something I've been
16:19
messing around with just one of the
16:21
first few things I've actually messed
16:22
around with in 1.13 is this birch and I
16:24
love it so much look at that it's it's
16:27
not too dark not too light somewhere in
16:29
between in fact I think the oak is very
16:31
similar to it but I want to use birch
16:33
because I never give birch enough lovin
16:35
and really dude do we ever do we ever
16:37
give birch enough love spruce it okay so
16:39
that's those are the two that that
16:40
really really see I see as much love as
16:43
the rest so let's do that
16:46
there that there I wasn't actually
16:48
thinking about this but we'll miss
16:50
around with it soon and then we'll go in
16:51
there with that one over and what I'm
16:54
thinking with this is we can maybe do
16:56
maybe do like a double storey thing
16:59
where actually I probably should pull
17:01
that out one but that's right well we'll
17:02
enter in on this level the blacksmith we
17:04
can go up get a bit of storage up here
17:07
maybe even storage down the bottom
17:08
you'll see how we go but either way I
17:09
think it'll just be a cool shaped house
17:11
to have up there maybe maybe just to bed
17:12
up there to start off with it's it's a
17:14
good symbol starting your own your first
17:16
house that's the thing it's more of like
17:17
a symbolic thing that finally you've
17:20
you've started the series you started
17:22
the world you've got a place to stay a
17:23
place to call home I think that's always
17:25
a good a good psychological thing to get
17:28
right so let's do this and let's go
17:31
ahead bring our very first crafting
17:33
table good I don't have it in a stack I
17:35
made another one a bit earlier our very
17:37
first crafting oh wait it's downstairs
17:38
here we'll take this one upstairs so
17:41
that we've got something to something to
17:43
work with what these guys I feel like
17:47
I'm gonna build this house
17:48
and everyone's gonna be in this house
17:49
must be they must realize that must be
17:52
an update in 1.13 villages now realize a
17:55
cool build when they see it so let's do
17:57
that we'll go three of them cuz I know
17:59
I'm gonna use these and spruce trapdoors
18:01
Oh as a say everybody's favorite trap
18:04
door so this over here is actually the
18:06
middle of the wall because it goes one
18:09
two three four five beautiful and let's
18:11
do a bit of this I'm pretty sure the oak
18:13
will be the best block for that for this
18:16
job because I think the oak actually
18:19
matches up quite well with this color
18:22
over here I have a hunch I have a hunch
18:25
okay maybe not as much but maybe not as
18:27
much as if it was an oak one there but I
18:29
think it matches up pretty well let's do
18:30
that and then well I guess we actually
18:33
need more of these up here so we'll just
18:34
steal two of these for now I want to get
18:36
the front piece done so we don't have to
18:38
worry too much about other stuff listen
18:40
that's my block thank you and around
18:44
here we'll go up there there and just
18:47
get this front piece sorted out so we
18:48
can see something pretty too to start
18:50
the series off with and then a good
18:52
little trick here's here's a trick
18:53
listen calm down buddy these guys I'm
18:58
telling you these guys what are we gonna
18:59
do with them so what we need to do here
19:01
actually that's way too many but that's
19:03
alright what we need to do here is make
19:04
ourselves some dark oak fences or any
19:06
any fence for that matter and this is a
19:08
good way when you haven't smelt it up
19:10
any glass to make a cool little window
19:12
and of course we can make a super simple
19:14
window this is something I do fairly
19:16
often this little design it's it just
19:18
works so damn good you've got got the
19:20
oak so while the stairs in there you can
19:22
go one two three with the slabs
19:24
listen slap get your stuff together in
19:26
fact I could even go with a bit of
19:28
spruce over here could work quite well
19:29
those in there and we can have to take
19:32
damage let's just jump down in fact it's
19:34
probably getting close to nighttime moat
19:36
so it's only over there look at that
19:38
that is beautiful this this today guys I
19:41
said listen we might not be lucky but I
19:43
think this is a great start finally
19:45
getting our house together here this is
19:47
this is gonna be good we hope I feel
19:49
like there's gonna be villages running
19:51
up there let's go get ourselves a little
19:52
bit of a little bit of birch as well so
19:54
as I say oh don't forget that the
19:57
question of the question of the series
19:59
really what is some villages you guys
20:02
would love to see maybe start off with
20:04
that I mean not ever do a hashtag do you
20:06
guys work it out in the comments but
20:08
maybe just tell me what you guys would
20:09
love to see and I'll put it on a list
20:11
and we can have a whole bunch of things
20:12
that we can build in this will because
20:13
of course the last series went for 150
20:16
episodes not 151 150 on the dot
20:19
definitely not an extra one and that
20:23
what that one I had so many cool ideas
20:25
and we've got so many places where we
20:26
can build those and I think just having
20:28
a bunch of ideas from the comments
20:30
because of course this is a youtube
20:32
series we can we can all build this
20:33
world together because we all kind of
20:34
have our own little belonging in this
20:36
world our own investment in the world
20:38
and I think they'll be super awesome too
20:40
to be able to do that together I just
20:43
want some more Burchill how much do we
20:44
have 16 of course of course we do and
20:47
I'm thinking this could be a cool
20:50
challenge alright we have started this
20:53
world with absolutely no wooden or stone
20:58
tools now just bear that in mind that's
21:01
a very rare start that you manage I mean
21:03
I suppose honestly anyone could do it if
21:05
you just search and so he kept lucky
21:06
with the iron but I feel like this could
21:08
be a good challenge let's just try and
21:10
see how long we can last without having
21:12
to make an oak oh well a wood or oh
21:15
that's a cool little floating island a
21:17
wooden or a stone tool let's see if we
21:21
can keep it iron and diamond the whole
21:23
way through
21:23
and I know what someone's gonna say
21:25
someone's gonna be like hey Jesse why
21:26
don't you use just iron no no use
21:28
diamond as well sneaky buggers actually
21:30
I guess we could use gold if we get gold
21:32
we're actually all right so some looks
21:34
like it's going down oh you know what
21:36
tell you it guys you guys get the
21:38
picture I'm gonna put a roof in here
21:39
simple roof
21:40
simple build simple start to the world
21:42
and I think it's gonna be a beautiful
21:43
little place for us to stain so I think
21:45
the sun's about to go down I'll just
21:46
chop down more spruce and more spruce
21:49
butch butch and we'll spruce up the
21:51
place how about that now can I ask
21:53
myself why do I make myself a challenge
21:56
the clip before I end up realizing I
21:58
needed Cynthia to make some tools so
22:02
we've got a little bit short on our
22:04
diamond not diamond what is this iron
22:07
iron axe which is a horrible thing so it
22:10
turns out we did need it and I was
22:12
completely wrong let's grab that
22:14
I decided we should probably light up
22:16
the area before we get creeped it we
22:17
haven't had a run-in yet and I do not
22:19
plan on it but you know what it's
22:21
probably gonna happen so here we go
22:23
we've got ourselves a little bit of a
22:25
place to look at I'll go step out back
22:26
here and I want to show you guys
22:28
introduce you guys to our brand new
22:30
house nothing too spectacular but it's a
22:33
good start it's it's actually an
22:34
interesting we'll start something which
22:36
I haven't done but I've always wanted to
22:37
do is go ahead and and adjust a village
22:41
Melissa flirt anyway adjust it maybe
22:44
upgrade a few things do some interesting
22:46
little things hey buddy and besides that
22:48
I've just got a whole bunch of
22:49
inspiration just recently on people who
22:51
do just that making some crazy stuff in
22:53
villages are we completely out of of
22:57
this good old stuff spruce or maybe no
23:00
we no we're not good I had that I had a
23:02
hunch right so what I want to do is we
23:04
want to make this place more homeland
23:06
and what is what is quite homely I think
23:08
a door how to speak quite homely in fact
23:11
I'm actually gonna make just one stack
23:13
of those these can go into these because
23:15
I'm gonna use them at some stage I'm
23:16
sure and what could be kind of useful
23:18
and I've also thought about this so it's
23:20
just do that there we go there we go so
23:24
what could be quite useful is this over
23:25
here is actually backing on to ground so
23:28
what we'll probably do is put all that
23:30
chests down in this room we'll have the
23:32
top story where we'll put our bed we'll
23:34
put maybe a we've got the furnaces
23:36
downstairs maybe like a crafting bench
23:38
maybe something else we can do up there
23:40
we'll see what we do maybe if we if we
23:42
go to the nether world when we get in
23:43
the nether we can get ourselves some a
23:45
bring stand and stuff like that so
23:46
here's another rule by the way for this
23:48
world which as I say I want to avoid
23:50
rules and as much stuff as what we did
23:52
in the last world but one thing I do
23:54
want to do is I don't want to be
23:55
traveling so far through the nether
23:57
because we've gone so far throughout the
23:59
overworld
24:00
so that's one thing which I would really
24:02
hope we can we can stick to and and not
24:05
to go too crazy on so let's just do
24:06
something like that no that's not gonna
24:08
work
24:08
I said I'll do it listen villagers you
24:11
guys are breaking my flow over here
24:15
fellas guys that guy almost did it he
24:17
always got me you're not gonna get me
24:19
today villager not today here we go
24:21
here's a simple way of doing it that in
24:23
there like that
24:25
and then we'll just put these around
24:27
here like this they're there they're
24:29
beautiful and of course because I had to
24:32
call it a little bit early on birching
24:35
we don't have any birch for that but
24:36
that's right
24:37
looking good good start and if we go
24:39
down here another great little piece
24:42
down the bottom here so that by the way
24:44
took one day and I think that one day
24:46
was our third day in the world let's
24:48
quickly do a quick Java update day for
24:50
poops
24:51
maybe one day too many maybe one day
24:53
extra but that's right you know what
24:54
guys we'll go ahead and and call it a
24:56
day over here because I think we pretty
24:58
much got started we've been we've just
25:02
got started in Minecraft 1.13 how crazy
25:05
is that so hopefully you guys have us as
25:08
excited as I am for the series cuz trust
25:10
me it's gonna be a great series we've
25:11

25:13
third so I'm very very excited for this
