00:00
hello everybody my name is python and
00:03
welcome back to another minecraft video
00:05
and ladies and gentleman this is the
00:07
first ever episode of my brand-new
00:10
minecraft series my new minecraft
00:12
journey is beginning today my friends on
00:14
this pythons world that is the name of
00:17
this series and I hope you guys are
00:19
excited through a drop of big fat thumbs
00:21
up to show you support if you are but
00:22
guys we are gonna go ahead and get into
00:25
this rod so I do indeed have a seat for
00:27
this one I spent a long time looking
00:28
around for seeds on amidst so I know
00:31
roughly where biomes are but I don't
00:33
actually know what's going on like in
00:34
terms of the terrain or underground or
00:36
anything like that I merely just looked
00:38
around for seeds that looked cool and
00:40
have the biomes that I want to have so
00:43
guys let's go ahead and type in pythons
00:44
world you saw the seed there but
00:47
obviously we're going to go ahead and
00:48
put it in the description of all of the
00:50
videos from this series as well so if
00:51
you guys want to go ahead and recreate
00:53
this more for yourselves then away you
00:56
go we are indeed only 1.13 snapshot 18w
01:00
11a which has the large majority of the
01:04
update aquatic stuffs the only things
01:06
missing at this point I do believe are
01:08
the Dolphins and the surface biomes that
01:11
can spawn in the water in the oceans
01:13
like icebergs and stuff but that's that
01:16
stuff will come to when it comes to it
01:18
but guys this is a pure vanilla let's
01:21
play no mods not even up to fine just
01:24
purely vanilla minecraft no texture
01:26
packs or anything like that so hope you
01:28
guys are excited for this I intend on
01:29
this one being like I say the final one
01:31
I intend on having this world for the
01:34
rest of my days like honestly I'm
01:36
drawing some serious inspiration from
01:37
b-dubs FL and wells like with all of
01:40
their seriously long-lasting Minecraft
01:42
Let's Plays I want to do that too I want
01:44
to do that too and I'm really really
01:45
excited to see what kind of things we
01:47
can get going in this well now I'm not
01:50
gonna lie I've got like a bunch of notes
01:51
for things I feel like I should mention
01:53
in this first episode because you know
01:55
it's the first episode it's you know
01:57
first impressions count and all that
01:59
kind of stuff so you know the more stuff
02:01
we get out of the way though the better
02:02
I guess but yeah I don't have any
02:05
intentions on doing like seasons of this
02:08
minecraft survival lets play pythons
02:10
world I intend on this just being
02:13
a long endless let's play whether it be
02:15
a hundred episodes whether it be 500
02:17
episodes I don't know we're just gonna
02:19
keep going and going and going and going
02:21
until I feel like we can't go anymore
02:24
or you know my craft just dies out and
02:26
Tyler which I don't foresee happening
02:27
for a very very long time yet so I think
02:30
we're good I think we're good but yes in
02:33
terms of the builds were going to be
02:34
doing on this fort I'm gonna be starting
02:36
off very very small-scale okay I think
02:38
what are the things that hurt my
02:40
minecraft my ability to build a whole
02:43
bunch is I always get myself into bigger
02:46
projects than I can actually do so let's
02:50
say for example we've got like a huge
02:51
massive castle which could take like 50
02:53
episodes to make like things like that
02:55
I'm not entirely sure that I want to do
02:57
that I want to go ahead and set myself
02:59
small goals within the survival series
03:02
whether it be like like within five
03:04
episodes I'd like to try and get this
03:06
amount of stuff done like I feel like
03:07
that might be the way to do it because
03:09
that's the way that other people seem to
03:11
do it and maybe that's the way I can do
03:13
it too so like I say we're gonna start
03:15
off with small builds and then maybe
03:17
just maybe upon the points where I feel
03:19
like I can make mega builds maybe we
03:21
could do some but like I say we're
03:23
starting off small scale and I just
03:25
realized something that was a birch tree
03:27
but there's oak leaves hmm very
03:32
interesting isn't it I'm not entirely
03:35
sure what's going on there guys but you
03:36
know it's a snapshot we can we have to
03:39
expect bugs and little discrepancies
03:41
here and there it's part of playing the
03:42
latest updates which is why I really
03:45
really like playing single-player
03:46
because I have the freedom to control my
03:49
own word I can update the snapshots
03:50
whenever the heck I want I could just do
03:52
all this stuff and everything I make in
03:54
my world is mine Leigh it's it's awesome
03:56
I don't mean yeah we do have hermit
03:59
crabs but you know I just I just can't
04:01
help but really really like the ability
04:05
to control the entire world myself you
04:06
know I'm saying like for me to go
04:08
without a single-player minecraft
04:09
survival let's play it's like oh man I
04:12
miss it too much like honestly I love
04:14
this game I love minecraft so damn much
04:16
my friends I've really do been playing
04:17
it since November 2010 my first ever
04:21
minecraft video being in December 2010
04:23
so yeah we've been going over set
04:26
News guys just really try to really try
04:30
to imagine that like I'm 23 years old at
04:32
the time of me recording this 7 to 8
04:35
years
04:35
that's what roughly what just over just
04:38
under just over a third of my entire
04:40
life had been playing Minecraft
04:41
that's insane like no other game in the
04:44
entire world has gripped me for as long
04:47
as minecraft hats and they must have
04:49
done something right they must have done
04:51
something right they were to have me
04:52
playing this long right so yeah but guys
04:55
check it out
04:56
we are indeed in a flower forest and
04:58
believe it or not this is actually my
04:59
favorite biome of all time and the
05:02
reason why that is is because look at
05:04
their colors look at the colors guys do
05:07
they not look amazing
05:08
I love the colorful nature of a flower
05:11
forest poem it is by far my favorite
05:13
microbiome going and that is the reason
05:15
why I picked this seed because the spawn
05:18
point was pretty much in a flower forest
05:20
biome which is really really awesome so
05:22
many ways let's go and make a bit of a
05:23
start on getting some tools up in this
05:26
business I probably should have done
05:27
this a little bit earlier but you know
05:29
all is good we live we learn and you
05:32
know learn we will but yeah the other
05:34
reason why I wanted to use this world
05:35
and the seed is because there is some
05:37
pretty darn awesome terrain generation
05:40
like for example check this out we've
05:41
got ourselves a roofed forest over in
05:43
that direction but we have got some
05:45
simply huge overhangs like look over
05:47
there look at those overhangs over there
05:49
like that is just screaming to be built
05:51
upon like I think that's really awesome
05:53
ooh a mini cave do we want to go down
05:56
here Oh while I remember actually we
05:58
should probably pull out on Hard
05:59
difficulty and lock it because that's
06:01
how I roll guys we roll like big boys in
06:03
this business yeah I love me some hard
06:07
difficulty that's awesome it just means
06:08
that there you know we could potentially
06:10
have some challenges here there and
06:12
everywhere I have no idea but yeah it's
06:15
just a regular minecraft survival lets
06:16
play aside from that but in terms of
06:19
like in terms of like common question of
06:21
the videos which I imagine all of you
06:23
older subscribers may be wondering about
06:24
absolutely we will be continuing with
06:26
that but obviously because this is the
06:28
first episode I don't really know what
06:30
to what to address first so if you guys
06:34
have any comments or questions then by
06:36
all means head down to the comments area
06:38
let me know because
06:40
no you might just get your question
06:42
answered within a video or whatever it
06:43
may be so all right so let us solve some
06:47
cobblestone let's grab ourselves a
06:48
fairness real quick
06:49
we are breezing through the traditional
06:51
Minecraft progression which is awesome
06:55
I'm very much a fan of that but at the
06:57
end of today's episode I would like to
06:58
have a basic starter shelter done and
07:00
and you know just just by doing that we
07:03
should be able to survive a little bit
07:05
easier but there we go let's have an axe
07:07
and some ourselves a shovel as well and
07:09
there we go we have a basic set of tools
07:10
very nice very very nice fantastic stuff
07:14
right so let's have a bit of an explore
07:17
let's up a bit of an explore maybe we
07:18
can find some even more epic terrain
07:21
okay I just fell down like a numpty oh
07:24
python come on man you could find some
07:27
cool stuff all right what's going on
07:29
over here is that a pit of death oh it's
07:31
not us interesting it's just a pit like
07:35
it's not even a cave it's just a weird
07:36
little pit and I don't understand it but
07:40
I don't mind it
07:41
whoa oh my goodness me look at this Oh
07:46
mate this is this is a heck of a spawn
07:50
point isn't it look at this there's like
07:52
an entire Cove going on down here Oh me
07:57
dude this has to be the place we set up
07:59
our first base I mean come on look at it
08:01
look at it it's amazing mr. Squidward do
08:04
you not agree that it is one of the most
08:06
amazing things you've ever seen oh I
08:07
can't even get him because he's like
08:09
gone away Oh give me some give me some
08:11
of that black dye yeah thanks buddy
08:14
I appreciate it hey that's right yeah
08:17
you got the new swimming as well look at
08:19
that well point 13 swimming it's awesome
08:21
my friends at autumn right so I'd like
08:25
to stop swimming now yep let me go
08:27
fantastic right I'm gonna grab some clay
08:29
the reason I'm doing this of course is
08:31
so we can actually decorate our first
08:33
house just a little bit better gets the
08:35
flowerpots going and all that kind of
08:36
stuff so we go ahead and pick all of
08:39
that up here we go and I can hear people
08:44
hmm I'm not entirely sure about this
08:47
not entirely sure about this guy's but
08:49
so hey look at this land though it's a
08:52
spider up there
08:53
there's peaks there chickens do we have
08:56
sheep and cows I mean those two will be
08:58
like the last of the the quintessential
09:00
animals right hmm
09:02
sheep of course would be very very nice
09:04
in order to set a spawn hey that guy
09:07
just fell down the frickin chicken is
09:10
going skinny-dipping except to use him
09:11
because he still got all of his feathers
09:13
if only you could share the feathers off
09:15
these guys too to get feathers just a
09:17
little easier I think that'd be pretty
09:19
cool actually like it's a feature
09:20
suggestion I'm pretty sure that a bunch
09:22
of moles do that but you know no no my
09:25
craft doesn't interest you anyway so
09:26
yeah all right so there we go grabbing a
09:29
bunch of wood we've got ourselves a good
09:30
supply here my friends a good supply
09:32
indeed we've got a very very nice flat
09:34
land here as well so I think what may be
09:37
a nice idea is if we begin making a bit
09:42
of a shape which is going to act as the
09:44
shape of our house I guess it's not
09:46
gonna be a big house not by any stretch
09:48
of the imagination but I kind of want to
09:49
make it look a little bit different than
09:51
all of the other houses that I've made
09:53
previously like maybe we could go for a
09:55
slightly more irregular shape right so
09:58
we could have double doors for our
10:01
entrance as well something like that
10:02
maybe we can start bringing this over
10:04
this way hmm this could be pretty cool
10:07
guys uh yeah this this is pretty nice
10:09
I'm liking the sofa all right so let's
10:12
chop down the crafting table real quick
10:13
we can hopefully get ourselves some cool
10:15
things going how about we go ahead and
10:19
chucks and stairs down rather like this
10:22
to act as some extra support some
10:24
additional support I think that'd be a
10:26
nice idea so let's go ahead and get that
10:28
rolling let's move over here do the same
10:32
okay that's looking good and then of
10:34
course we've got some at the front had
10:35
to do as well yeah here we go mate this
10:38
is gonna be a bang in first base it's
10:40
gonna be amazing
10:40
okay so intention is to go ahead and
10:43
place that some stone something like
10:45
this and then maybe on the outside here
10:47
ah if only I had some if only I had some
10:51
she is I'd be able to go and grab some
10:52
leaves and start lining them around the
10:54
outside that'd be really nice actually
10:56
okay so we need a little bit more
10:59
cobblestone actually I mean there's all
11:01
of that cave over there but I think I'd
11:03
prefer getting it from some sort of like
11:06
cave that's not really
11:07
so anyway yeah like down here for
11:09
example I think that's a cool idea hi
11:10
boys
11:11
let's grab ourselves out some
11:12
cobblestone we'll continue on the basic
11:14
frame of the house and hopefully we can
11:16
make a first base that looks pretty
11:18
respectable because you know all the
11:20
ones of may before have seemed pretty
11:22
tiny I want to be able to actually live
11:24
in this one so yeah that's why I'm
11:26
spending the time to do this so yeah
11:28
let's get everybody guys so we're
11:30
continuing to build well into the night
11:32
time here as you can see I have the
11:34
frame of the house down at this point
11:36
and I've also got some various materials
11:39
melting up right now which is very very
11:40
cool so why don't we go ahead and grab
11:42
the crafting table bring that inside and
11:45
then we can make a bit of a start on the
11:47
interior here so we've got ourselves a
11:49
nice little entrance here we could
11:50
probably go and put ourselves like a
11:51
little bit of a welcoming carpet or
11:53
something we'll put down a chest right
11:55
there we can make a sell wait that's a
11:58
lot of chests that's a crafting table
11:59
now we could put down the chest right
12:00
there okay let's grab ourselves out some
12:03
glass real quick have ourselves some
12:06
nice little windows windows always go a
12:08
long way in a board in my opinion so why
12:10
don't we go and do that a little bit
12:12
more just one more and then I can
12:15
actually get on with finishing these
12:17
here windows and then we can really get
12:19
on with the ceiling because that's like
12:21
their last elements of this there we go
12:23
and as you can see the Sun is starting
12:25
to rise awesome stuff there's plenty of
12:28
enemies around but I can't quite
12:29
identify where they are they must be in
12:32
a cave system beneath me that's the only
12:33
thing I could deduce really so yeah I'm
12:36
not looking forward to exploring that
12:37
with my friends that's for sure
12:41
well hey how all is good I hope you guys
12:42
are enjoying the episode I really really
12:44
do and I hope you guys are okay with me
12:45
making you know jump cuts here in there
12:48
I mean I don't know maybe Pole on screen
12:50
do you guys prefer it when I cut away so
12:52
we can get to the more interesting stuff
12:54
a little more quicker or do you guys
12:56
prefer it when I actually build on
12:58
camera and try to explain my thought
13:00
processes I mean let me know I'd be very
13:02
interested to know I really would ooh
13:03
I'd be interested in this iron No heck
13:06
yeah buddy
13:07
all right we've got anymore anymore
13:09
anymore I mean two is pretty good for a
13:11
pair of shoes never gonna complain about
13:13
that yeah our boys we're looking good
13:17
we're looking good and yeah that's stuff
13:19
going on wait what
13:21
weird block lag on a single-player world
13:23
what is this nonsense I do not
13:26
understand right anyway so let's get
13:27
back in here just jump over the windows
13:29
because that's all we can do and let's
13:32
start placing in the top section like
13:35
this
13:36
there we go that's looking pretty good
13:37
we've got an egg can we have ourselves a
13:39
resident chicken sadly not all right
13:42
what about a couple of flower pots maybe
13:45
make a little bit of a star on the
13:47
interior
13:48
I think I'd be a nicer day because we're
13:50
in a flower forest I feel like it's only
13:52
right so I have actual flowers in the
13:54
flower pots as opposed to saplings like
13:55
I usually do so yeah re let's have a bit
13:59
of a look around
14:00
oh hello there's a zombie over there he
14:03
appears to be having a bad day Oh yep
14:05
he's dead well done what is going on
14:08
over there I have no idea he done just
14:10
got burnt
14:11
he should have jumped them into the
14:13
water and became a turned mob that would
14:15
have been interesting yeah that's all
14:17
one point 13 feet yeah cool do you know
14:20
what it would be really nice if I could
14:22
try and obtain a trident really early in
14:25
the series just to have a variety of
14:27
weapons going on because for those of
14:29
you guys who don't know in 1.13 the
14:31
update aquatic there is a primary weapon
14:33
available for you guys to have which is
14:35
called the Trident and it is exactly
14:37
what you think it is it is like it's
14:39
it's beautiful it really is it's like a
14:40
blue and white trident thing you can
14:43
throw it and also use as a melee weapon
14:45
so it's like a it's kind of like a
14:47
hybrid weapon it's excellent it really
14:49
really is I can't remember the last time
14:51
a new weapon a brand new weapon was
14:53
introduced into the game like I don't
14:56
know like pre-alpha when either bows or
14:58
swords were added something like that
15:00
I've no idea
15:01
I really don't but anyways let's get
15:03
anyone maybe we smelt up these old tools
15:06
I think that'd be a nice idea there you
15:08
go
15:09
we're giving them a use even though we
15:11
don't need them anymore there we go so
15:13
we're going a couple bits of iron so we
15:15
can hopefully make ourselves a bed and
15:17
then from there on in things should be
15:19
looking pretty nice I mean we just need
15:22
to think of other things to put in these
15:23
spaces we'll have like a bed here maybe
15:25
like a chest next to it or like a little
15:27
maybe we put down like a bark block
15:30
and then another flap on top of it you
15:33
know this place look really really nice
15:35
and who knows maybe this time we can put
15:38
a sapling on it as well
15:39
why not why not there you go all right
15:42
hey achievements awesome stuff all right
15:46
let's have a little bit of a normal nice
15:48
eh apples and guys we're going for a bit
15:51
of a sheep hunt let's see what we can
15:53
find
15:55
hopefully we can find some pretty easy
15:57
here I'm not looking for like a massive
16:01
exploration session just to find sheep
16:03
I'm gonna be honest with you guys I'd be
16:05
nice if we could just find them straight
16:07
out although with that said I'm kind of
16:09
a fan of finding these sugarcane
16:11
straight out and there's a shape up
16:12
there fantastic
16:13
hey buddy you're gonna be the first ever
16:15
sheep to be Shawn within this minecraft
16:18
letsplay
16:19
man this is going to be nuts like you
16:21
have a heck of a title on you buddy
16:24
the first ever sheath to be Shawn and
16:25
did I get three no I didn't I you know
16:28
I'm just gonna all of them the
16:30
first pack of sheep should I say there
16:32
we go fantastic Oh boys let's get back
16:34
to base we'll continue working on the
16:36
ceiling and indeed the interior and
16:38
we'll see what it looks like once its
16:40
service is done so I'm happy to say that
16:43
the exterior is pretty much there as you
16:46
can see with my shoes I got myself a
16:49
whole bunch of leaf blocks and as you
16:50
can see I've decorated the outside of
16:52
the house with them which is looking
16:53
very very nice now very much a fan of
16:56
that so all we need to do now as far as
16:58
I know is the interior so why don't we
17:00
go ahead and make a little bit of a
17:02
start on that so why don't we begin by
17:05
flattening off the ceiling here and then
17:08
very simply doing something like this I
17:12
think this could look pretty nice oh
17:15
hang on I am messing this up I think
17:17
what are you doing I need a little bit
17:20
more in the stair Department and then
17:22
we're just about there right so yeah
17:25
that's looking good
17:27
that's look good okay and maybe as a
17:29
little bit of an addition to the
17:32
interior perhaps we could add in a few
17:35
paintings here in there maybe one there
17:36
maybe one there and maybe like in the
17:39
center there Oh mate that's looking good
17:41
that is looking good all right ladies
17:44

17:46
